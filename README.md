# Case Converter

Experimenting with `DOM`, `getElementById()`, `querySelector()` and `addEventListener()`

## Working with ID

To select the elements, the use of `id` attribute was employed. As I continue with the project, I will add classes to upgrade the project.

## Event Listeners

To change the text on button click, the use of `addEventListener()` was employed, and the `click` event handler selected. In addition to change the value within the textarea, the use of `.value` and the corresponding function was required.

## Function

Work is still needed on the custom functions, `sentencCase()` and `properCase()` as there is most probably the need for refactoring.

## Design

The design will be improved as times goes on.
